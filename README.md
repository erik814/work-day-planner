# Work Day Planner

## Description

This is an interactive work day planner.

When you open up the page, you will be shown the current date, aswell as a section for each hour from 9am to 5pm.

As the time changes, so does the planner. Hours that have already passed will appear gray. The current hour will appear green. Future hours will appear blue.

The gray, green, or blue section can be clicked, and "to do" items can be typed into that space. After you type in the content, you can click the blue save button to the right to save your text to the local storage. If you refresh the page or reopen it later, your "to do" tasks will still appear in the text box.

## Tasks

For this project, I was given some starter HTML and CSS. I worked in the HTML to update the structure of the page, specifically adding my hour blocks. 

## What I Learned

One of the biggest things I learned with this project was how much the difficulty of a project can scale depending on size. Writing a few functions and getting everything to work is pretty easy. But when you have a lot of functions and data moving around, it can be incredibly easy to get lost or overwhelmed. One thing that really helped me was to draw the process out on a notebook.
