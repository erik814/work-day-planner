# Work Day Planner

## Description

This is an interactive work day planner.

When you open up the page, you will be shown the current date, aswell as a section for each hour from 9am to 5pm.

As the time changes, so does the planner. Hours that have already passed will appear gray. The current hour will appear green. Future hours will appear blue.

The gray, green, or blue section can be clicked, and "to do" items can be typed into that space. After you type in the content, you can click the blue save button to the right to save your text to the local storage. If you refresh the page or reopen it later, your "to do" tasks will still appear in the text box.

## Tasks

For this project, I was given some starter HTML and CSS. I worked in the HTML to update the structure of the page, specifically adding my hour blocks. I did some work in CSS as well using bootstrap to add rows and columns, and a little bit of a more polished look. Most of my work was in javascript. Getting the color of the hour blocks to change with the time was really quick and easy, as was saving information to and pulling from the local storage. The part I struggled with the most was getting the information pulled from local storage to display in the correct hour block.

## What I Learned

On this project, I learned a lot about working with arrays of objects and loops. I also finally started trying to use some jQuery and arrow functions. They still feel unfamiliar to me, but I'm going to continue practing them.
